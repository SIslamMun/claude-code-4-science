## âš¡ Performance Profiling

Target application: $ARGUMENTS

I'll delegate to the hpc-expert who has exclusive access to performance profiling MCPs.

### Profiling Analysis
- **I/O characterization** using mcp__darshan__*
- **Hardware monitoring** using mcp__node_hardware__*
- **Communication patterns** for MPI applications
- **Memory access** patterns and cache efficiency
- **Vectorization** opportunities

### Deliverables
1. **Performance report** with bottleneck identification
2. **Optimization recommendations** ranked by impact
3. **Scaling analysis** (strong and weak)
4. **Implementation plan** for optimizations
5. **Before/after metrics** for validation

The hpc-expert will use darshan and hardware monitoring MCPs for deep performance analysis...
