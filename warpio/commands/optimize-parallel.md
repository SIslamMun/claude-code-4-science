## ðŸš€ Parallel Code Optimization

Code to optimize: $ARGUMENTS

I'll engage the hpc-expert to optimize your parallel implementation.

### Optimization Strategies
- **Load balancing** - Even work distribution
- **Communication optimization** - Minimize MPI overhead
- **Overlap computation/communication**
- **Cache optimization** - Improve data locality
- **Vectorization** - SIMD instructions

### Process
1. **Profile baseline** using darshan MCPs
2. **Identify bottlenecks** with hardware monitoring
3. **Apply optimizations** targeted to architecture
4. **Validate improvements** with benchmarking
5. **Document changes** with performance gains

The hpc-expert will optimize using their exclusive performance analysis tools...
