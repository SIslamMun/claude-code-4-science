# Create Scientific Workflow

**Workflow Name:** $ARGUMENTS

I'll help you create a new scientific workflow using Warpio's expert system and workflow orchestration capabilities.

## Workflow Creation Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- **Domain identification** (data science, HPC, research, etc.)
- **Task breakdown** into manageable components
- **Resource requirements** (compute, storage, data sources)
- **Success criteria** and deliverables

### 2. Expert Assignment
- **Data Expert**: Data preparation, format conversion, optimization
- **HPC Expert**: Compute resource management, parallel processing
- **Analysis Expert**: Statistical analysis, visualization
- **Research Expert**: Documentation, validation, reporting
- **Workflow Expert**: Orchestration, dependency management, monitoring

### 3. Workflow Design
- **Pipeline architecture** (sequential, parallel, conditional)
- **Data flow** between processing stages
- **Error handling** and recovery strategies
- **Checkpointing** and restart capabilities
- **Monitoring** and logging setup

### 4. Implementation
- **Code generation** for each workflow stage
- **Configuration files** for parameters and settings
- **Test data** and validation procedures
- **Documentation** and usage instructions
- **Deployment scripts** for execution

## Available Templates

Choose from these pre-built workflow templates:

**Data Processing:**
- `data-ingest`: Raw data ingestion and validation
- `format-conversion`: Convert between scientific data formats
- `data-cleaning`: Data preprocessing and quality control

**Analysis Workflows:**
- `statistical-analysis`: Statistical testing and modeling
- `machine-learning`: ML model training and evaluation
- `visualization`: Publication-ready figure generation

**HPC Workflows:**
- `parallel-computation`: Multi-node parallel processing
- `parameter-sweep`: Parameter exploration studies
- `optimization-study`: Performance optimization workflows

**Research Workflows:**
- `reproducible-experiment`: Reproducible research setup
- `literature-analysis`: Automated literature review
- `publication-prep`: Manuscript preparation pipeline

## Interactive Setup

I'll guide you through:
1. **Template selection** or custom workflow design
2. **Parameter configuration** for your specific needs
3. **Resource allocation** and environment setup
4. **Testing and validation** procedures
5. **Deployment and execution** instructions

The workflow will be created with proper expert delegation, error handling, and monitoring capabilities.
