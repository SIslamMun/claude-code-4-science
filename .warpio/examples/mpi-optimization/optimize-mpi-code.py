    Warpio HPC Expert would analyze and optimize MPI code.
    
    Optimization workflow:
    1. Profile with Darshan to identify I/O bottlenecks
    2. Analyze communication patterns with mcp__zen__analyze
    3. Suggest non-blocking communication where applicable
    4. Recommend collective operations over point-to-point

    üñ•Ô∏è Warpio HPC Expert Analysis
    ================================
    
    Communication Pattern Issues Found:
    - Excessive MPI_Send/MPI_Recv pairs ‚Üí Use MPI_Isend/MPI_Irecv
    - Sequential file writes ‚Üí Switch to MPI-IO collective operations
    - Imbalanced workload ‚Üí Implement dynamic load balancing
    
    Performance Improvements:
    - Communication overlap: 40% reduction in wait time
    - I/O optimization: 3x faster with collective writes
    - Load balancing: 25% better scaling efficiency
    
    SLURM Configuration:
    - Nodes: 16 (optimal for problem size)
    - Tasks per node: 32 (matches core count)
    - Memory: 4GB per task
    - Partition: compute (exclusive access)
    
    Generated Files:
    - optimized_mpi_code.c (with improvements)
    - submit_job.slurm (production-ready script)
    - performance_report.md (detailed metrics)
